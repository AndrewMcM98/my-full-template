/*--Use of float:Okay, so the first thing we want to do with our cards is we want them to float left,
this means that they'll all appear in a single row. We want them side by side rather than stacked
on top of each other. 
Now it’s worth pointing out that this is relative width size. It's relative to the parent
container that the image is inside. In this case, the image’s parent container is the card class,
the div with the class of card. Now the card has a width of 20%,
which will take up 20% of the total screen space. The image with a width of 100% will take up 100%
of this 20%, meaning the image will take up 20% of the width of the screen.--*/
